# Convening Deliberation

## Overview

Thin convening wrapper over `geas deliberation append`. Spawns the voter set for a task-level or mission-level judgment, dispatches each voter independently, and records one deliberation entry with the aggregated result. The skill never computes its own final judgment; the CLI's aggregation rule is the source of truth.

<HARD-GATE> Deliberation is permitted only when `mission-spec.mode == full_depth`. Lightweight and standard missions rely on the decision-maker's direct judgment. Voters never see each other's votes before voting. Inconclusive rounds are not recorded — convene again with a revised composition instead.

## When to Use

- Task-level: required reviewer verdicts conflict on incompatible grounds, or challenger raises a structural objection closure cannot adjudicate alone, or the rewind target is non-obvious.
- Mission-level: `full_depth` specifying-phase close requires documented agreement among ≥3 voters including challenger, or phase rollback is under consideration.
- Do NOT use for choices inside a worker's domain, minor refactors, or any judgment the contract routes to a single slot.
- Do NOT use in `lightweight` or `standard` missions — the CLI rejects with `guard_failed`.

## Preconditions

- `mission-spec.mode == full_depth`.
- Proposal text is stated plainly in one line.
- Voter roster is ≥2 slots; challenger is included whenever available.
- Supporting artifacts (contract, evidence, phase-review, prior deliberation) are identified for each voter.
- `level` is decided: `task` (writes under `tasks/{task_id}/deliberations.json`) or `mission` (writes under `missions/{id}/deliberations.json`).

## Process

1. **Assemble the roster.**
   - Pick ≥2 voter slots. Include challenger whenever the proposal has risk-level ≥ high implications or affects mission direction.
   - Resolve each slot to a concrete agent from the profile's agent map; the same concrete agent cannot hold implementer + reviewer on the same task.
2. **Brief each voter in parallel.**
   - Spawn the concrete agent for each slot. Hand them: the proposal text, pointers to supporting artifacts, and the instruction to invoke `deliberating-on-proposal` and return a vote (`agree` / `disagree` / `escalate`) + rationale.
   - Voters dispatch concurrently where practical. They do NOT receive each other's votes before voting.
   - Apply the same slot- and risk-driven dispatch pattern that `scheduling-work` describes: authority voters (`challenger`, `decision-maker`, `design-authority`) aim for the most capable model the harness exposes; specialist voters (`risk-assessor`, `operator`, `communicator`, `verifier`, `implementer`) aim for a balanced choice, lifted toward the most-capable end when the task or proposal has `risk_level` of `high` or `critical`. Mission-level deliberations inherit the proposal's effective risk; if unclear, treat them as high. A task contract's per-task rationale, when present, takes precedence. Canonical guidance: [scheduling-work/SKILL.md](../scheduling-work/SKILL.md) under "Dispatch Model".
3. **Collect votes and compute expected `result`** per the CLI aggregation rule:
   - any `escalate` → `escalate`
   - else majority `agree` → `agree`
   - else majority `disagree` → `disagree`
   - else (tie or fewer than two voters) → `inconclusive`
4. **Handle inconclusive locally.** If the expected result is `inconclusive`, do NOT call the CLI. Revise the composition or the proposal, return to step 1.
5. **Record the entry via CLI.** `geas deliberation append` accepts inline flags (preferred for short rationales) or a full JSON payload via `--file`. For the exact field list, run `geas schema template deliberation --op append`.

   Inline form — `--vote` is repeatable and takes a `voter:vote:rationale` shorthand triple per voter:
   ```bash
   geas deliberation append --mission <id> --level task --task <id> \
       --proposal-summary "one-line summary of the question" \
       --vote "challenger:disagree:rationale text from challenger" \
       --vote "risk-assessor:agree:rationale text from risk-assessor" \
       --vote "decision-maker:agree:rationale text from decision-maker" \
       --result agree
   ```
   For mission-level deliberation drop `--task` and use `--level mission`. Use `--proposal-summary-from-file <path>` (stage the prose in .geas/tmp/ using the current client's file-write mechanism) when the summary runs long.
   The full-payload `--file <path>` form remains as a back-compat alias for callers who already author the full JSON; never use a bash heredoc — apostrophes / quotes inside any voter's rationale break shell parsing.

   CLI checks: mode gate, ≥2 voters, voter slots in enum, rationales non-empty, `result` matches aggregation. Mismatch → `guard_failed`.
6. **Feed the result back to the caller.**
   - `agree` → proposal becomes the path forward; caller (running-gate, reviewing-phase, specifying-mission) acts on it.
   - `disagree` → proposal is rejected; caller revises or escalates to a decision-maker call.
   - `escalate` → one or more voters want the decision to go up; caller writes a phase-review or mission-verdict entry or escalates to decision-maker.

## Red Flags

| Excuse | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Only one reviewer disagreed — skip deliberation, just override" | Incompatible reviewer verdicts are exactly what this skill exists for. Overriding corrupts the audit trail. |
| "Let voters see prior votes for efficiency" | Voters are independent by construction. Circulating votes destroys the independence guarantee that makes the result meaningful. |
| "Record the inconclusive round so we have something on file" | Inconclusive means the deliberation failed. Recording it falsifies the audit. Convene again with a revised composition. |
| "The mission is standard, not full_depth, but this decision is important" | Mode gate is enforced by CLI. Important decisions in standard mode go to decision-maker directly, not to a faked deliberation. |

## Invokes

| CLI command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `geas deliberation append --mission <id> --level {task\|mission} [--task <id>]` | Record the concluded round; CLI validates mode, voters, aggregation. |

Sub-skills invoked: `deliberating-on-proposal` (spawned in parallel, one per voter slot).

## Outputs

- `.geas/missions/{mission_id}/tasks/{task_id}/deliberations.json` (task-level) or `.geas/missions/{mission_id}/deliberations.json` (mission-level) grows by one entry per concluded round.
- No other artifacts written by this skill.

## Failure Handling

- **Mode gate `guard_failed`**: mission is not `full_depth`; return to caller, route the judgment to decision-maker instead.
- **Aggregation mismatch `guard_failed`**: recomputed `result` differs from the declared one; recompute via the rule, resubmit.
- **Schema rejection** (rationale empty, voter outside enum, <2 voters): fix the payload, resubmit.
- **Voter unavailable**: pick an alternate slot from the profile map, document the substitution in the rationale, proceed.
- **Inconclusive**: do not record; return to step 1 with a revised roster or proposal.

## Related Skills

- **Invoked by**: mission dispatcher in `full_depth` missions when reviewer verdicts conflict (dispatched via `running-gate`), when challenger raises structural objection, or on phase rollback (via `reviewing-phase`) or specifying-phase close (via `specifying-mission`).
- **Invokes**: `deliberating-on-proposal` (spawned, one per voter).
- **Do NOT invoke**: `running-gate` — that runs after deliberation resolves the Tier 2 conflict. `deciding-on-approval` — decision-maker is a voter here, not an adjudicator.

## Remember

- The aggregation rule is owned by the CLI; the skill only reports votes honestly.
- Voters are independent; vote content never circulates mid-round.
- One entry per concluded round; revotes after a revised proposal are new entries, not amendments.
- `inconclusive` is a signal to convene again, not a verdict to record.
- Challenger's vote is captured even when agreeing — the rationale is the audit substrate.
