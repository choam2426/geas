# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

> **Note**: Tags were restructured in v0.5.1. Previous major versions (v1.x, v2.x) have been flattened to v0.x.y to reflect that the project is pre-1.0.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- `geas schema list` — lists all available schema types (15 types)
- `geas schema template <type> [--role <role>]` — generates fill-in JSON templates from schema definitions; `--role` selects evidence role variants (implementer, reviewer, tester, authority)
- Validation error hints — `hints` field in VALIDATION_ERROR responses provides correct field names, allowed enum values, and required/optional status
- Envelope auto-injection — `version`, `artifact_type`, `producer_type`, `artifact_id` are automatically injected by the CLI; agents no longer need to provide these fields
- 18 regression tests for schema templates, envelope injection, and validation hints

### Changed
- Skills: inline schema templates removed from skill text, replaced with `geas schema template` CLI calls
- `task create` enforces `status: "drafted"` regardless of input value

## [1.0.1] — 2026-04-10

README rewrite, project structure cleanup, versioning fix.

### Changed
- README (en + ko) rewritten: icon hero, highlight cards, restructured sections, accurate pipeline/hook counts
- Evidence Gate tier descriptions corrected (Tier 0 Precheck / Tier 1 Mechanical / Tier 2 Contract+Rubric)
- Vote Round and Gap Assessment added to README feature list
- Korean README: natural tone, English section titles and technical terms
- CLAUDE.md simplified: removed migration history, merged redundant rules, removed derivable skill lists
- Project description updated across plugin.json and marketplace.json
- `dashboard/` moved to `src/dashboard/` for consistent source layout
- `marketplace.json` version fields removed (breaks `/plugin update` auto-detection)

### Fixed
- Pipeline step count: 14 → 15 across all docs (CLAUDE.md, DESIGN.md, orchestration.md, help SKILL.md)
- Hook count: 9 → 10 across all docs

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-10

First stable release. Dashboard, progressive skill loading, domain flexibility, and full test-driven polish.

### Added
- **Tauri desktop dashboard** — real-time kanban board, timeline, memory browser, debt panel, toast notifications (Windows / Linux / macOS)
- Trivial task bypass — `/geas:mission` skips the full pipeline for obvious small fixes
- Session handoff suggestion at specifying→building boundary (5+ tasks)
- Progressive skill loading — SKILL.md reduced to 53-line router, orchestration rules loaded on demand
- Orchestrator reads its own memory note at startup
- `geas mission create` auto-generates mission ID when `--id` is omitted
- `geas evidence add --phase` flag for phase-level evidence (polishing, evolving)
- `rules.md` template with sub-agent rules: evidence by role, scope enforcement, review standards, knowledge sharing
- Schema field references in skills for 6 artifact types to prevent field name guessing
- Agent Review Protocols sections (7 agents) — single source for review checklists

### Fixed
- `enrichTimestamp` Windows path regex bug
- `geas task record add` now shallow-merges instead of replacing sections
- `format: "date-time"` Ajv warning removed
- `created_at` removed from required in all schemas (CLI auto-injects)
- Architecture transition table aligned with actual guard conditions
- `rules-update` producer_type conditional on status
- Design review clarified as not a task
- 66 snake_case agent type references converted to kebab-case
- Intake/design-brief field name mismatches with schemas

### Changed
- `domain_profile` is now a hint, not a hard constraint — mixed-domain missions supported
- Phase-level evidence stored in `polishing/evidence/` and `evolution/evidence/`
- Mission directory: removed `contracts/`, `packets/` (v3 remnants); added `polishing/`
- Agent-specific review checklists moved from skill prompts to agent.md
- Protocol 09: `producer_type` semantics clarified
- README rewritten with dashboard screenshots, feature list, help command

## [0.8.1] — 2026-04-10

Test session analysis fixes — schema friction, CLI usability, skill guidance.

### Fixed
- `format: "date-time"` removed from `_defs.schema.json` — suppresses Ajv `unknown format ignored` warning on every CLI validation
- `geas task record add` now shallow-merges into existing sections instead of replacing — partial updates (e.g., changing just `status`) no longer require resending all fields
- Redundant user confirmation at specifying→building transition removed
- Mission-spec field reference added to intake skill (`scope` is nested object, not flat `scope_in`/`scope_out`)
- Gap-assessment must be written before phase review — explicit ordering note in building.md
- `rules-update` `producer_type`: conditional on status — omit when `status: "none"`, required (domain authority) otherwise
- `producer_type` semantics clarified in protocol 09 (en + ko): the agent whose judgment produced the content
- Phase-level evidence stored in phase-specific directories (`polishing/evidence/`, `evolution/evidence/`) instead of creating pseudo-task directories (`tasks/polishing/`, `tasks/evolving/`)

### Changed
- `geas evidence add`: added `--phase` flag for mission-level evidence (mutually exclusive with `--task`)
- `geas mission create`: removed `contracts/`, `packets/`, `evidence/` subdirectories (v3 remnants); added `polishing/`
- `rules.md` template: sub-agent focused rules (evidence by role, scope enforcement, review standards)
- Orchestrator reads its own memory note (`.geas/memory/agents/orchestration-authority.md`) at startup
- Mission SKILL.md refactored to 53-line router with progressive loading — orchestration rules moved to `references/orchestration.md`, loaded only when full pipeline is needed
- Session handoff suggestion at specifying→building boundary (5+ tasks)
- Trivial task bypass — skip full pipeline for obvious small fixes
- Agent-specific review checklists moved from skill prompts to agent.md `Review Protocols` sections (7 agents, 5 skill files slimmed)
- Design review clarified as NOT a task — no contract or evidence, result lives in design-brief
- Knowledge sharing rule added to rules.md template — agents must update rules.md for cross-agent knowledge
- Design-brief field reference expanded: `depth` (not mode), `constraints` (array), `reviewer_type` (const)

## [0.8.0] — 2026-04-10

Schema alignment, Windows compatibility, flexible agent selection, and CLI improvements.

### Fixed
- `enrichTimestamp` Windows path regex bug — regex required leading `/`, failing on Windows paths like `A:/...`. Replaced with `includes`/`endsWith` pattern. Same fix applied to `checkScopeAndFrozenSpec` and `checkTaskPassedEvidence`.
- Intake skill field name mismatches with mission-spec schema: `risks` → `risk_notes`, `scope.surfaces` → `affected_surfaces`
- Intake skill `producer_type` example used snake_case (`orchestration_authority`) instead of kebab-case
- 66 snake_case agent type references across 17 skill/agent files converted to kebab-case per Agent Name Rule
- Design-brief field name mismatches: added schema field reference to specifying.md (`rejected_reason`, `description`, `design_review` structure)
- Added schema field references for recovery-packet, record (gate_result, closure, challenge_review), evidence, rules-update to prevent agent field name guessing

### Changed
- `created_at` removed from `required` in all 12 schemas — CLI auto-injects, agents no longer need to include it
- `domain_profile` is now a hint, not a hard constraint — orchestrator freely selects the best agent per task from the full agent pool. Mixed-domain missions (research + development) can use agents from any domain.
- `profiles.json`: `slot_mapping` renamed to `defaults` (semantic clarity)
- Slot resolution in pipeline/specifying/polishing: mandatory profile lookup replaced with best-fit agent selection
- Protocol 02 metadata table now maps conceptual field names to schema field names (en + ko)
- Intake skill: `created_at` no longer manually included — CLI auto-injects

### Added
- Optional `updated_at` field added to 13 schemas that have `created_at` (CLI auto-injects on file updates)
- `geas mission create` auto-generates mission ID when `--id` is omitted — orchestrators no longer need to generate IDs manually

## [0.7.0] — 2026-04-10

CLI restructure, pipeline enforcement, and process reliability improvements.

### Breaking
- CLI source moved from `plugin/cli/` to `src/cli/` (development only)
- CLI is now a pre-built single-file bundle at `plugin/bin/geas`
- `--cwd` flag no longer required for worktree agents (auto-detection via git)

### Changed
- CLI uses esbuild single-file bundle with embedded JSON schemas (no runtime fs reads)
- `resolveGeasDir` uses `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` to always find main repo `.geas/`, even in worktrees
- Setup Phase 0 simplified: no more `npm install && npm run build` — CLI is pre-bundled
- All worktree Agent() prompts simplified: `geas` replaces `node {project_root}/plugin/cli/index.js --cwd {project_root}`
- Pipeline `remaining_steps` now includes `integration` step
- `integrated` state transition moved to worktree merge point (after gate pass)
- Building→Polishing transition now clears checkpoint and current_task_id
- Evolving phase: `phase: complete` must be set last (triggers CLI auto-cleanup)
- Setup: `.geas/` gitignore is now user's choice (not forced)

### Added
- `plugin/bin/geas` — single-file CLI bundle, auto-registered in PATH by Claude Code
- `drafted → ready` transition explicitly added to pipeline Start Task
- Integration step in pipeline: merge + worktree cleanup after gate pass
- Mission SKILL.md Gotchas section (4 items: TaskCreate confusion, lightweight mode, orchestrate-only, commit≠skip)
- Lightweight mode clarification in specifying.md
- CLI `state update --field phase --value complete` auto-clears mission_id, mission, completed_tasks
- Help skill mandatory display rule

### Fixed
- Help skill output not displayed to user (just said "displayed")
- CLI commands failing after `cd plugin/cli` changed session CWD
- Stale CLI builds causing "unknown command" errors

### Removed
- `plugin/cli/` directory (replaced by `src/cli/` + `plugin/bin/geas`)
- Setup Phase 0 CLI build step (no longer needed)
- Worktree `--cwd` requirement in all skill files

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-09

Skill-schema alignment, process UX improvements, naming unification, and skill optimization.

### Security
- CLI path traversal defense: validateIdentifier() + assertContainedIn() on 7 commands
- Replace silent sanitization with rejection in memory, packet, decision commands
- .geas/ write-block hook (PreToolUse) prevents direct Write/Edit to runtime state

### Changed
- Agent type naming unified to hyphens across schemas, agents, profiles, CLI, examples
- Agent Name Rule in CLAUDE.md updated (hyphen-only convention)
- Intake skill now asks for mode (lightweight/standard/full_depth) explicitly
- Setup skill uses CLI-only writes (state init, memory init-rules)
- Evolving phase has checkpoint management for all agent spawns
- All 13 skills have Input/Output sections

### Added
- /geas:help skill with usage guide, commands, and workflow explanation
- task-contract schema: dependencies array field
- mission-spec schema: existing_project source enum
- task-compiler/references/examples.md with annotated examples
- CLI commands: state init, memory init-rules
- VALID_PHASES enum validation in evolution.ts

### Fixed
- Skill-schema mismatches: scope.surfaces, concrete agent types, field names
- Specifying phase had exactly one task-list approval (no double approval)

### Documentation
- SKILLS.md and HOOKS.md updated with help skill and write-block hook
- Protocol example files updated to use hyphenated agent names
